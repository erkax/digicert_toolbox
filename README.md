Digicert toolbox to automaticly generate and submit CSR

Done and Ok:
 - generate private key 
 - generate CSR (with and without SANS)
 - submit CSR to digicert

ToDo:
 - Add a few tests
 - Certificate validation directly from this tool (a co-worker still need to 
   do it through the digicert website)
 - Certificate download script (still need to use the digicert website)

Thx to @cjcotton and @erantanen for the inspring code
